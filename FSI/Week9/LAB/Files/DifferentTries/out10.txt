THE OSCARS TURN  ON SUNDAY WHICH SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT AFTER THIS LONG STRANGE
AWARDS TRIP THE BAGGER FEELS LIKE A NONAGENARIAN TOO

THE AWARDS RACE WAS BOOKENDED BY THE DEMISE OF HARiEY WEINSTEIN AT ITS OUTSET
AND THE APPARENT IMPLOSION OF HIS FILM COMPANY AT THE END AND IT WAS SHAPED BY
THE EMERGENCE OF METOO TIMES UP BLACKGOWN POLITICS ARMCANDY ACTIiISM AND
A NATIONAL CONiERSATION AS BRIEF AND MAD AS A FEiER DREAM ABOUT WHETHER THERE
OUGHT TO BE A PRESIDENT WINFREY THE SEASON DIDNT kUST SEEM EdTRA LONG IT WAS
EdTRA LONG BECAUSE THE OSCARS WERE MOiED TO THE FIRST WEEKEND IN MARCH TO
AiOID CONFLICTING WITH THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS THANKS
PYEONGCHANG

ONE BIG eUESTION SURROUNDING THIS YEARS ACADEMY AWARDS IS HOW OR IF THE
CEREMONY WILL ADDRESS METOO ESPECIALLY AFTER THE GOLDEN GLOBES WHICH BECAME
A kUBILANT COMINGOUT PARTY FOR TIMES UP THE MOiEMENT SPEARHEADED BY 
POWERFUL HOLLYWOOD WOMEN WHO HELPED RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT SEdUAL
HARASSMENT AROUND THE COUNTRY

SIGNALING THEIR SUPPORT GOLDEN GLOBES ATTENDEES SWATHED THEMSELiES IN BLACK
SPORTED LAPEL PINS AND SOUNDED OFF ABOUT SEdIST POWER IMBALANCES FROM THE RED
CARPET AND THE STAGE ON THE AIR E WAS CALLED OUT ABOUT PAY INEeUITY AFTER
ITS FORMER ANCHOR CATT SADLER eUIT ONCE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MAKING FAR
LESS THAN A MALE COHOST AND DURING THE CEREMONY NATALIE PORTMAN TOOK A BLUNT
AND SATISFYING DIG AT THE ALLMALE ROSTER OF NOMINATED DIRECTORS HOW COULD
THAT BE TOPPED

AS IT TURNS OUT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE OSCARS IT PROBABLY WONT BE

WOMEN INiOLiED IN TIMES UP SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE GLOBES SIGNIFIED THE
INITIATIiES LAUNCH THEY NEiER INTENDED IT TO BE kUST AN AWARDS SEASON
CAMPAIGN OR ONE THAT BECAME ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH REDCARPET ACTIONS INSTEAD
A SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE GROUP IS WORKING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND HAS SINCE
AMASSED  MILLION FOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE FUND WHICH AFTER THE GLOBES WAS
FLOODED WITH THOUSANDS OF DONATIONS OF  OR LESS FROM PEOPLE IN SOME 
COUNTRIES


NO CALL TO WEAR BLACK GOWNS WENT OUT IN ADiANCE OF THE OSCARS THOUGH THE
MOiEMENT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE REFERENCED BEFORE AND DURING THE CEREMONY 
ESPECIALLY SINCE iOCAL METOO SUPPORTERS LIKE ASHLEY kUDD LAURA DERN AND
NICOLE KIDMAN ARE SCHEDULED PRESENTERS

ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS SEASON NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHO IS GOING TO WIN BEST
PICTURE ARGUABLY THIS HAPPENS A LOT OF THE TIME INARGUABLY THE NAILBITER
NARRATIiE ONLY SERiES THE AWARDS HYPE MACHINE BUT OFTEN THE PEOPLE FORECASTING
THE RACE SOCALLED OSCAROLOGISTS CAN MAKE ONLY EDUCATED GUESSES

THE WAY THE ACADEMY TABULATES THE BIG WINNER DOESNT HELP IN EiERY OTHER
CATEGORY THE NOMINEE WITH THE MOST iOTES WINS BUT IN THE BEST PICTURE
CATEGORY iOTERS ARE ASKED TO LIST THEIR TOP MOiIES IN PREFERENTIAL ORDER IF A
MOiIE GETS MORE THAN  PERCENT OF THE FIRSTPLACE iOTES IT WINS WHEN NO
MOiIE MANAGES THAT THE ONE WITH THE FEWEST FIRSTPLACE iOTES IS ELIMINATED AND
ITS iOTES ARE REDISTRIBUTED TO THE MOiIES THAT GARNERED THE ELIMINATED BALLOTS
SECONDPLACE iOTES AND THIS CONTINUES UNTIL A WINNER EMERGES

IT IS ALL TERRIBLY CONFUSING BUT APPARENTLY THE CONSENSUS FAiORITE COMES OUT
AHEAD IN THE END THIS MEANS THAT ENDOFSEASON AWARDS CHATTER INiARIABLY
INiOLiES TORTURED SPECULATION ABOUT WHICH FILM WOULD MOST LIKELY BE iOTERS
SECOND OR THIRD FAiORITE AND THEN EeUALLY TORTURED CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHICH
FILM MIGHT PREiAIL

IN  IT WAS A TOSSUP BETWEEN BOYHOOD AND THE EiENTUAL WINNER BIRDMAN
IN  WITH LOTS OF EdPERTS BETTING ON THE REiENANT OR THE BIG SHORT THE
PRIoE WENT TO SPOTLIGHT LAST YEAR NEARLY ALL THE FORECASTERS DECLARED LA
LA LAND THE PRESUMPTIiE WINNER AND FOR TWO AND A HALF MINUTES THEY WERE
CORRECT BEFORE AN ENiELOPE SNAFU WAS REiEALED AND THE RIGHTFUL WINNER
MOONLIGHT WAS CROWNED

THIS YEAR AWARDS WATCHERS ARE UNEeUALLY DIiIDED BETWEEN THREE BILLBOARDS
OUTSIDE EBBING MISSOURI THE FAiORITE AND THE SHAPE OF WATER WHICH IS
THE BAGGERS PREDICTION WITH A FEW FORECASTING A HAIL MARY WIN FOR GET OUT

BUT ALL OF THOSE FILMS HAiE HISTORICAL OSCARiOTING PATTERNS AGAINST THEM THE
SHAPE OF WATER HAS  NOMINATIONS MORE THAN ANY OTHER FILM AND WAS ALSO
NAMED THE YEARS BEST BY THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS GUILDS YET IT WAS NOT
NOMINATED FOR A SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARD FOR BEST ENSEMBLE AND NO FILM HAS
WON BEST PICTURE WITHOUT PREiIOUSLY LANDING AT LEAST THE ACTORS NOMINATION
SINCE BRAiEHEART IN  THIS YEAR THE BEST ENSEMBLE SAG ENDED UP GOING TO
THREE BILLBOARDS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE ACTORS MAKE UP THE ACADEMYS
LARGEST BRANCH THAT FILM WHILE DIiISIiE ALSO WON THE BEST DRAMA GOLDEN GLOBE
AND THE BAFTA BUT ITS FILMMAKER MARTIN MCDONAGH WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR BEST
DIRECTOR AND APART FROM ARGO MOiIES THAT LAND BEST PICTURE WITHOUT ALSO
EARNING BEST DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
