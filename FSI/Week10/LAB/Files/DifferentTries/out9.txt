THE AWARDS RAsE WAS BOOlENDED BY THE DEMISE OF HARiEY WEINSTEIN AT ITS OUTSET
AND THE APPARENT IMPLOSION OF HIS FILM sOMPANY AT THE END AND IT WAS SHAPED BY
THE EMERaENsE OF METOO TIMES UP BLAslaOWN POLITIsS ARMsANDY AsTIiISM AND
A NATIONAL sONiERSATION AS BRIEF AND MAD AS A FEiER DREAM ABOUT WHETHER THERE
OUaHT TO BE A PRESIDENT WINFREY THE SEASON DIDNT kUST SEEM EdTRA LONa IT WAS
EdTRA LONa BEsAUSE THE OSsARS WERE MOiED TO THE FIRST WEElEND IN MARsH TO
AiOID sONFLIsTINa WITH THE sLOSINa sEREMONY OF THE WINTER OLYMPIsS THANlS
PYEONasHANa

ONE BIa eUESTION SURROUNDINa THIS YEARS AsADEMY AWARDS IS HOW OR IF THE
sEREMONY WILL ADDRESS METOO ESPEsIALLY AFTER THE aOLDEN aLOBES WHIsH BEsAME
A kUBILANT sOMINaOUT PARTY FOR TIMES UP THE MOiEMENT SPEARHEADED BY 
POWERFUL HOLLYWOOD WOMEN WHO HELPED RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIaHT SEdUAL
HARASSMENT AROUND THE sOUNTRY

SIaNALINa THEIR SUPPORT aOLDEN aLOBES ATTENDEES SWATHED THEMSELiES IN BLAsl

sARPET AND THE STAaE ON THE AIR E WAS sALLED OUT ABOUT PAY INEeUITY AFTER
ITS FORMER ANsHOR sATT SADLER eUIT ONsE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MAlINa FAR
LESS THAN A MALE sOHOST AND DURINa THE sEREMONY NATALIE PORTMAN TOOl A BLUNT
AND SATISFYINa DIa AT THE ALLMALE ROSTER OF NOMINATED DIREsTORS HOW sOULD
THAT BE TOPPED

AS IT TURNS OUT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE OSsARS IT PROBABLY WONT BE

ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS SEASON NO ONE REALLY lNOWS WHO IS aOINa TO WIN BEST
PIsTURE ARaUABLY THIS HAPPENS A LOT OF THE TIME INARaUABLY THE NAILBITER
NARRATIiE ONLY SERiES THE AWARDS HYPE MAsHINE BUT OFTEN THE PEOPLE FOREsASTINa
THE RAsE SOsALLED OSsAROLOaISTS sAN MAlE ONLY EDUsATED aUESSES

THE WAY THE AsADEMY TABULATES THE BIa WINNER DOESNT HELP IN EiERY OTHER
sATEaORY THE NOMINEE WITH THE MOST iOTES WINS BUT IN THE BEST PIsTURE
sATEaORY iOTERS ARE ASlED TO LIST THEIR TOP MOiIES IN PREFERENTIAL ORDER IF A
MOiIE aETS MORE THAN  PERsENT OF THE FIRSTPLAsE iOTES IT WINS WHEN NO
MOiIE MANAaES THAT THE ONE WITH THE FEWEST FIRSTPLAsE iOTES IS ELIMINATED AND
ITS iOTES ARE REDISTRIBUTED TO THE MOiIES THAT aARNERED THE ELIMINATED BALLOTS
SEsONDPLAsE iOTES AND THIS sONTINUES UNTIL A WINNER EMERaES

IT IS ALL TERRIBLY sONFUSINa BUT APPARENTLY THE sONSENSUS FAiORITE sOMES OUT
AHEAD IN THE END THIS MEANS THAT ENDOFSEASON AWARDS sHATTER INiARIABLY
INiOLiES TORTURED SPEsULATION ABOUT WHIsH FILM WOULD MOST LIlELY BE iOTERS
SEsOND OR THIRD FAiORITE AND THEN EeUALLY TORTURED sONsLUSIONS ABOUT WHIsH
FILM MIaHT PREiAIL

IN  IT WAS A TOSSUP BETWEEN BOYHOOD AND THE EiENTUAL WINNER BIRDMAN
